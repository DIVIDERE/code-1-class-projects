class notes:



Object: an entity in your program that you can manipulate by calling one or more of its methods (numbers are not objects).

Method: consists of a sequence of instructions that can access the data of an object. to declare a method, specify the types of arguments and the return value, example: public int length().

Class: describes a set of objects with the same behavior (starts with uppercase).

Variable: stores a value that you want to use later (case sensitive, starts with lowercase). typeName variableName = value or typeName variableName. use int for numbers that cannot have a fractional part. use double for decimals.

Object Variable: doesn't actually hold the object, but instead refers to it.

Argument: method inputs.

Construction: the process of creating a new object. done by using: new

Package: a group of Java classes that must be imported to use that class. done by using: import.

comments are done using // or /* and */

Accessor Method: returns information about the object and doesn't change the data of the object.

Mutual Method: changes the data of the object.
